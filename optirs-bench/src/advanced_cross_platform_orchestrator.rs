// Advanced Cross-Platform Testing Orchestrator
//
// This module provides sophisticated cross-platform testing capabilities with cloud provider
// integration, containerized testing environments, automated test matrix generation,
// and comprehensive platform compatibility validation.
//
// The implementation has been refactored into a modular structure for better maintainability:
// - Each component is separated into focused modules under `advanced_cross_platform_orchestrator/`
// - All original functionality is preserved through comprehensive re-exports
// - New convenience functions and improved APIs are available
//
// # Migration Note
// All existing imports and usage patterns remain unchanged. The modular refactoring is
// internal and does not affect the public API.

// Re-export all functionality from the modular implementation
pub use self::advanced_cross_platform_orchestrator::*;
