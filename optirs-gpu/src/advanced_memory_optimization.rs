// Advanced GPU memory optimization for large-scale training
//
// This module provides advanced memory optimization techniques for large-scale
// neural network training, including memory-efficient gradient accumulation,
// activation checkpointing, and dynamic memory management.
//
// The implementation has been refactored into a modular structure for better maintainability:
// - Each optimization technique is separated into focused modules under `advanced_memory_optimization/`
// - All original functionality is preserved through comprehensive re-exports
// - New convenience functions and improved APIs are available
// - Enhanced testing and documentation
//
// # Migration Note
// All existing imports and usage patterns remain unchanged. The modular refactoring is
// internal and does not affect the public API.

// Re-export all functionality from the modular implementation
pub use self::advanced_memory_optimization::*;

// Declare the submodule
