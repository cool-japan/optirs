// Deadlock Detection and Prevention
//
// This module provides comprehensive deadlock detection, prevention, and recovery mechanisms
// for distributed TPU synchronization including graph-based algorithms and resource management.
//
// This module has been refactored into focused submodules for better maintainability:
// - `types`: Core types and configuration structures
// - `algorithms`: Detection algorithms and optimization strategies
// - `prevention`: Prevention strategies and policies
// - `graph`: Dependency graph management and analysis
// - `performance`: Performance monitoring and statistics
// - `recovery`: Recovery coordination and execution
// - `ml`: Machine learning components for prediction
//
// All original functionality is preserved through comprehensive re-exports.

// Re-export everything from the modular deadlock module
pub use deadlock::*;

// Include the modular deadlock implementation
pub mod deadlock;
